# Xpress Health - Wellness Center

UNISA Final Year Project - NDip IT

## Description

PHP based ecommerce application built as my final year project. The project started with a simple spreadsheet that was converted to a MySQL database 
with a web-based interface built using PHP, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I used my own implementation of a MVC design pattern.

Libraries used for pdf documents and email functionality as well as notifications:
FPDF
PHPMailer
Noty

### Installing

* Clone or download the project files to your local machine. I used xampp as my localhost server but any PHP localhost implemetation will work.
* Import the xpress_health.sql script to create all tables and create a user with the following credentials:
user: xpress_admin
password: leyvosYRnFHPujCH
All Data privileges
